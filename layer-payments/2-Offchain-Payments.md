# Off-chain Payments

## Off-chain Payments (Custodian)
In the off-chain payment model, the payments between Lenders and Borrowers are settled by traditional payments providers (Payment Processors). The Payment Processor in Growr protocol is required to issue "proof-of-pay" credentials to attest the payments are settled. The Payment Processor might also facilitate the payments between Liquidity Providers and Lenders in case of off-chain pond funding.
