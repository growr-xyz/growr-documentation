# Borrower Credentials
The Growr protocol relies on a new type of decentralized identity that we call the **Self-sovereign Financial Identity (SSFI)**. It stores a user's unique global identity and contains various **Veriﬁable Credentials (VCs)** from different sources that are used to assert creditworthness in from of the lending ponds. 
## Credentials Issuing
Credentials are provided by **credential issuers** – that is, centralized or decentralized third parties, asserting certain facts about the user.
Several examples of verifiable credentials are presented in the sections below.
