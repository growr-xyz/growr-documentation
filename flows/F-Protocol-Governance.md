# Protocol Governance
## Governance Token
TBD. Details on protocol token economics will be provided in the next version of the protocol documentation. 

## Governance Board
### Pool Factory governance
The Governance Board will manage the deployed instance of the Pool Factory smart contract and will decide on:
- Applicable lending pool parameters
- Backstop potentially fraudulent pools

### Pond Factory governance
The Governance Board will manage the deployed instance of the Pond Factory smart contract and will decide on:
- Applicable lending pond parameters
- Backstop potentially fraudulent ponds

### Trusted Service Registry governance
The Governance Board will manage the deployed instance of the global Trusted Service Registry smart contract and will decide on:
- New trusted Risk Assessors to be added
- New trusted Issuers to be added
- Risk Assessors and Issuers with bad behavior or low performance to be removed

### Governance of other registries
The Governance Board could also support and supervise the management of other registries (usually managed by Credential Issuers) such as:
- Credential Status list
- Credential Revocation list

## Safety Funds
In order to provide the Governance Board with incentive to assume responsibility for governance failures, Growr will require the board members to stake their tokens to activate governance power. As an additional safety measure, the protocol will continuously route a portion of the fees generated by the protocol to the safety funds of the protocol.
