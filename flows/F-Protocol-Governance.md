## Pond Factory governance
The Protocol Governance Board will manage the deployed instance of the Pond Factory smart contract and will decide on:
- Applicable lending pond parameters

## Verification Registry governance
The Protocol Governance Board will manage the deployed instance of the global Verification Registry smart contract and will decide on:
- New trusted Risk Assessors to be added
- Risk Assessors with bad behavior or low performance to be removed
## Governance of other registries
The Protocol Governance Board could also manage other registries such as:
- Trusted Issuers registry
- Credential Status/Revocation list
## Safety Funds governance
In order to provide the DAO with incentive to assume responsibility for governance failures, Growr will require DAO members to stake their tokens to activate governance power. As an additional safety measure, the protocol will continuously route a portion of fees generated by the protocol to the safety funds of the protocol.
