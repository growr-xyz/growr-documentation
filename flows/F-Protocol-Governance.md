# Protocol Governance
## Pool Factory governance
The protocol governance will govern the deployed instance of the Pool Factory smart contract and will decide on:
- Applicable lending pool parameters
- Backstop potentially fraudulent pools
## Pond Factory governance
The protocol governance will govern the deployed instance of the Pond Factory smart contract and will decide on:
- Applicable lending pond parameters
- Backstop potentially fraudulent ponds
## Verification Registry governance
The protocol governance will govern the deployed instance of the global Verification Registry smart contract and will decide on:
- New trusted verifiers to be added
- Verifiers with bad behavior or low performance to be removed
## Safety Funds governance
In order to provide the DAO with incentive to assume responsibility for governance failures, Growr will require DAO members to stake their tokens to activate governance power. As an additional safety measure, the protocol will continuously route a portion of fees generated by the protocol to a safety fund.
The safety funds will be organized in 3 levels:
- Safety fund on Pond level - will be filled with portions from the generated pond yield; it will be used as a first source of recovery to cover losses from bad debtors;
- Safety fund on Pool level - will be filled with portions from the generated pool yield; it will be used as a second source of recovery to compensate losses bad performing ponds;
- Safety fund on Protocol level - will be filled with part of the staked tokens; it will be used as a last source of recovery to cover significant pool or pond loses caused by exploits or attacks from bad actors.
