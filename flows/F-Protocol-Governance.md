# Protocol Governance

- Backstop potentially fraudulent pools
## Pond Factory governance

## Verification Registry governance
The protocol governance board will manage the deployed instance of the global Verification Registry smart contract and will decide on:
- New trusted Risk Assessors to be added
- Risk Assessors with bad behavior or low performance to be removed
## Governance of other registries
The protocol governance board could also manage other registries such as:
- Trusted Issuers registry
- Credential Status/Revocation list
## Safety Funds governance
In order to provide the DAO with incentive to assume responsibility for governance failures, Growr will require DAO members to stake their tokens to activate governance power. As an additional safety measure, the protocol will continuously route a portion of fees generated by the protocol to a safety fund.--
The safety funds will be organized in 3 levels:
- Safety fund on Pond level - will be filled with portions from the generated pond yield; it will be used as a first source of recovery to cover losses from bad debtors;
- Safety fund on Pool level - will be filled with portions from the generated pool yield; it will be used as a second source of recovery to compensate losses bad performing ponds;
- Safety fund on Protocol level - will be filled with part of the staked tokens; it will be used as a last source of recovery to cover significant pool or pond loses caused by exploits or attacks from bad actors.
