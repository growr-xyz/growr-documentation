### Verification Registry governance
The Governance Board will manage the deployed instance of the global Verification Registry smart contract and will decide on:

- Risk Assessors with bad behavior or low performance to be removed

### Governance of other registries

## Safety Funds
In order to provide the Governance Board with incentive to assume responsibility for governance failures, Growr will require the board members to stake their tokens to activate governance power. As an additional safety measure, the protocol will continuously route a portion of the fees generated by the protocol to the safety funds of the protocol.
