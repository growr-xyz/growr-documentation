Growr is a DeFi protocol operating on several layers:
- The processes in **Liquidity layer** are related to provisioning of the necessary funds for the protocol operation. Liquidity Providers and Lenders are collaborating on this layer.
- The **Risk Management layer** is the key layer of the protocol, it's the "magic" of the protocol. All processes related to local scoring and assessment, and loan management are happening on this layer.
- The **Distribution** layer covers the processes of onboarding and providing Borrowers with access to the protocol.
- The **Payments** layer combines all payment processes that occurs accross all layers.
- The processes for smart contract governance and fraud are covered in the **Governance layer**.
