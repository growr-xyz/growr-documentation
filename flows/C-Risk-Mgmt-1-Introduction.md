# Risk Management Introduction
Growr protocol introduces an innovative approach for decentralized credit risk management that should work in the same way in both custodial and non-custodial model.  
The approach follows several key principles.
## Responsibility split
Each participant in the ecosystem has a risk management role:
- Credential Issuers assert facts about the Borrowers in the form of credentials
- Credential Verifiers validates the credentials
- Risk Assessors orchestrate the risk assessment activities and confirms that a Borrower matches the loan requirements
- Registry Smart Contracts validate that risk assessment is prepared by trusted assessors
- Pond Smart Contracts take decision based on the input from the test of the participants
- Protocol Governance Board decides which participants are trusted and excludes the one that misbehave
## Incentivization
Each participant is incentivized by the protocol to fairly fulfil its duties.
