# Safety Funds
As a measure against potential losses from fraudulent and unfair protocol participants, Growr protocol relies on **safety funds**. They will be organized in 3 levels:
- Safety fund on **Pond** level - will be filled with portions from the generated pond yield; it will be used as a first source of recovery to cover losses from bad debtors;
- Safety fund on **Pool** level - will be filled with portions from the generated pool yield; it will be used as a second source of recovery to compensate losses bad performing ponds;
- Safety fund on **Protocol** level - will be filled with part of the staked tokens; it will be used as a last source of recovery to cover significant pool or pond loses caused by exploits or attacks from bad actors.
