# Pond funding
The Growr protocol enables institutional liquidity providers to fund lending pools according to their risk/reward appetite.

## On-chain Model
A local pond can be funded in 2 ways – directly (independently) or by applying for funds from a global pool (with or without local self-participation). 
### Direct pond funding

### Pool-to-pond funding
The Growr protocol is able to operate on 2 levels – global pools and local ponds. Global pools are funded by institutional investors who then delegate the actual lending activity to local guilds with local lending ponds. 
A lending pool can be created by any institutional investor with enough capital (threshold to be deﬁned by the protocol governance) who speciﬁes the initial pool parameters. Investors can safely deposit funds into lending pools according to their preferences and based on automatic vetting using their own SSFI and veriﬁable credentials, e.g., applicable AML/CFT checks, required by the pool creator.
The flow for pool creation and funding is the same as the flow for pond creation and funding. For more details, visit [Pond Creation section](/flows/E-Liquidity-1-Pond-Creation.md). 
Local ponds then apply for funds from the pool resulting in so called "contract-to-contract (C2C) lending". Depending on the pond ﬁnancing period, fund requirements, proposed risk model and eligibility criteria, the pool automatically decides to approve or not the funding to the pond. This is how it works:
