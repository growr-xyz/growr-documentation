# Protocol Overview

## Problem
Today, a quarter of the world's adult population does not have an account [(link)](https://ufa.worldbank.org/en/ufa). In some countries in the developing world, financial exclusion is as high as 90%. Most of the unbanked population do not have a "job" – they are smallholder farmers,  micro-entrepreneurs or self-employed. They are all facing a staggering financing gap of over US$5 trillion per year [link](https://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/03522e90-a13d-4a02-87cd-9ee9a297b311/121264-WP-PUBLIC-MSMEReportFINAL.pdf). In addition, only a third of adults worldwide are financially literate, and as a result can easily become prey to loan sharks [(link)](https://globalﬁndex.worldbank.org/sites/globalﬁndex/ﬁles/chapters/2017%20Findex%20full%20report_chapter5.pdf).
Today, most financial service providers do not solve those problems. They are clueless about people's real-life problems, needs and aspirations. There's a complete disconnect between the person and the provider. Banks, and even more so non-banking lenders, have a negative image especially with younger generation, who, as a result, are more likely to go to the dentist than visit a bank.
While others are working on democratizing access to accounts, payments and remittances through the use of decentralized protocols, the typical DeFi protocols today require over-collateralization, which is completely out of the reach of the unbanked.

## Solution
Growr protocol aims to be a bridge between 2 worlds – decentralized finance and microfinance, while addressing each one’s challenges. The protocol enables micro-entrepreneurs to receive instant productive loans based on their self-sovereign credit record, without the need for over-collateralization. In contrast to traditional microfinance, Growr enables an open and global lending marketplace that connects borrowers to both traditional and decentralized lenders, enforcing fair competition for pricing and the fully transparent deployment of capital down to each micro-loan.

The Growr protocol combines instant unsecured loans, innovative credit assessment models, decentralized identity and financial health incentivization. How does Growr works:
1. Borrowers rely on trusted parties to assert facts about them in the form of credentials. Those trusted parties include local organizations that has knowledge about their community – cooperatives, unions, chambers, employers, merchants.​
2. Those local organizations might additionally partner with fintechs, retailers or employers or other participants in the respective economy to submit a joint proposal for credit line to one or more lenders. The lenders assess the proposed loan parameters, price (rate and fees) and eligibility criteria, and depending on their risk/reward appetite, approve or reject the credit line. In case of positive outcome, the lenders publish a new loan offer to the marketplace.​
3. The borrowers then are able to use their financial record with collected credentials to easily apply for a loan from the marketplace and receive the money they need to achieve their goals.​

The Growr protocol contributes with a strong positive impact on financial inclusion by providing open access to basic financial services:
- **Borrowers**, represented by self-employed, micro-businesses, smallholder farmers and the communities of which they are members, are provided with access to fair productive loans to grow their business. In addition, they receive help and promotion of financial health and good business practices.
- **Suppliers and buyers** that support the development of sustainable local economies have a revenue growth, as well as easier and streamlined agreements with a cooperative instead of with each member individually. 
- **Liquidity providers** in the ecosystem benefit from new customer base and new yield generation opportunities on a global scale, and in addition they get a complete transparency of the impact of each dollar they invest.

The key elements of the protocol are: 
- **Growr core protocol** – open and global lending marketplace on top of Bitcoin that connects borrowers with lending providers who publish their targeted loan offers with predefined conditions and eligibility criteria.
- **Self-sovereign credit record (SSCR)** – a global digital identity, based on W3C's DID and VC data models, owned and managed by the user, and storing various protocol-specific verifiable credentials based on user’s financial health metrics, on-chain activity, and trusted off-chain data.
- **Decentralized credit risk assessment** – a framework for establishing trust based on alternative risk assessment and verifiable credentials instead of requiring an on-chain collateral.
- **Financial Health incentivization** - embedded protocol tools and features for personalized financial health journeys, such as "learn and earn", "saving habits" and "controlled spending", that can be used for additional credit assessment and incentivization of the borrowers.
