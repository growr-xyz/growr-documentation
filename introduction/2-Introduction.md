# Protocol Overview

## Problem
Financial health is an important factor in our daily life. However, bad financial health is plaguing the world. More than half of the global population is living paycheck-to-paycheck without any savings [https://globalﬁndex.worldbank.org/sites/globalﬁndex/ﬁles/chapters/2017%20Findex%20full%20report_chapter5.pdf](https://globalﬁndex.worldbank.org/sites/globalﬁndex/ﬁles/chapters/2017%20Findex%20full%20report_chapter5.pdf). In addition, almost 2 billion adults in the world do not have access to financial services [https://ufa.worldbank.org/en/ufa](https://ufa.worldbank.org/en/ufa) or if they do, they  fall prey to financial sharks and receive loans at a very high interest rate. Moreover, there are still 72 countries where women from specific social groups do not have the right to open a bank account or obtain credit [https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GGGR_2020.pdf](https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GGGR_2020.pdf).

Today, most financial service providers do not solve those problems. They are clueless about people's real-life problems, needs and aspirations. There's a complete disconnect between the person and the provider. Banks, and even more so non-banking lenders, have a negative image especially with younger generation, who, as a result, are more likely to go to the dentist than visit a bank.

## Solution
Our research showed that most of the unbanked population are self-employed or people working for micro and small businesses.​ We propose the **Growr protocol** as a bridge between 2 ecosystems - DeFi and microfinance. Growr helps people in need build their global credit record, store it in their pocket, under their full control, and use it to access a marketplace with fair productive loans.​ 

The Growr protocol combines instant unsecured loans, innovative credit assessment models, decentralized identity and financial health incentivization. How does Growr works:
1. Borrowers rely on trusted parties to assert facts about them in the form of credentials. Those trusted parties include local organizations that has knowledge about their community – cooperatives, unions, chambers, employers, merchants.​
2. Those local organizations might additionally partner with fintechs, retailers or employers or other participants in the respective economy to submit a joint proposal for credit line to one or more lenders. The lenders assess the proposed loan parameters, price (rate and fees) and eligibility criteria, and depending on their risk/reward appetite, approve or reject the credit line. In case of positive outcome, the lenders publish a new loan offer to the marketplace.​
3. The borrowers then are able to use their financial record with collected credentials to easily apply for a loan from the marketplace and receive the money they need to achieve their goals.​

With Growr, all participants are incentivized for positive behavior. 
- With regularly repaid loans, **Borrowers** improve their credit score metrics and get better lending conditions. 
- The **Credential Issuers** support the economy they are part of, and additionally receive a fee for the services they provide. 
- The **Liquidity Providers** rely on the local ecosystem participants to decrease their cost of default, and to receive profit from transparently allocated capital.​

The key elements of the protocol are: 
- **Growr core protocol** – global decentralized marketplace on top of Bitcoin where lending providers publish their targeted loan offers with predefined conditions and eligibility criteria.
- **Self-sovereign financial identity (SSFI)** – a digital identity, based on W3C's DID and VC standards, owned and managed by the user, and storing their financial record with credentials from various sources – such as bank accounts, KYC services, certificates from local organizations, as well as their financial health metrics.
- **Decentralized credit risk assessment** – a framework for establishing trust based on alternative risk assessment and verifiable credentials instead of requiring an on-chain collateral.
- **Financial Health incentivization** - embedded protocol features, such as "going through a fin health education", "creating savings habits", "building a long-term positive financial reputation", that enable borrowers to receive better financial services.
