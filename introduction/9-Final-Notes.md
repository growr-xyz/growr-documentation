# Final Notes

## ToDo
You are reading Growr protocol documentation in progress, intended to present the high-level design of the protocol for public feedback. It should not be considered complete or final. Future revisions will address incomplete elements and currently unforeseen aspects and issues.

The present Growr documentation version is *0.3.0*.

## Feedback
Our goal is to develop Growr as an open source protocol. Lending, and especially *decentralized uncollateralized lending*, is a very complex topic and there are many aspects that are yet to consider. We welcome your input on how to improve the protocol.

Please, submit an issue or pull request at Growr documentation repo in GitHub on [https://github.com/growr-xyz/growr-documentation/](https://github.com/growr-xyz/growr-documentation/).

## Contribution
Growr protocol is an open-source decentralized project and anyone can permissionlessly contribute to its development. Developing the protocol, the team abide to the following values:
- **Freedom**. Growr ensures equal starting point and free access to the protocol for everyone.
- **Transparency**. Growr provides services with fair conditions, end-to-end transparency in the process and visible impact.
- **Contribution**. Growr promotes open-source, community-driven, and safe environment.
- **Empowerment**. Growr delivers global life-first innovative financial services.

We truly hope that the mission and values we describe inspire teams across the world to join us and help contribute to the protocol.
