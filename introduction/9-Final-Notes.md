# Final notes

## Work in progress

This Growr protocol’s documentation is a work in progress, intended to present the high-level design of the protocol for public feedback. It should not be considered complete or final. Future revisions will address incomplete elements and currently unforeseen aspects and issues.

The present Growr documentation version is 0.5 from August 2022.

## Feedback and contribution

We are developing the Growr protocol as an open-source project. Lending, and especially _decentralized micro-lending_, is a very complex topic and many aspects are yet to consider. We welcome your input on how to improve the protocol and support its development.

To provide your feedback, please submit an issue or a pull request in the [Growr documentation repo on GitHub](https://github.com/growr-xyz/growr-documentation/).
