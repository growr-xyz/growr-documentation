# Final Notes

## ToDo
You are reading first version of Growr protocol documentation, intended to present the high-level design of the protocol for public feedback. It should not be considered complete or final. Future revisions will address incomplete elements and currently unforeseen aspects and issues.

The present Growr documentation version is *0.2*.

## Feedback
Our goal is to develop Growr as an open source protocol. Lending, and especially *decentralized uncollateralized lending*, is a very complex topic and there are many aspects that are yet to consider. We welcome your input on how to improve the protocol.

Please, submit an issue or pull request at [Growr documentation repo in GitHub](https://github.com/growr-xyz/growr-documentation/).

## Contribution
Growr protocol is an open-source decentralized project and anyone can permissionlessly contribute to its development. We truly hope that the mission and values we describe inspire teams across the world to join us and help contribute to the protocol.
