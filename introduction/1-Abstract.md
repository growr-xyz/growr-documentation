# Abstract
Growr is an open, fair and sustainable lending protocol on top of Bitcoin. Growr enables institutional and individual investors to fund lending pools according to their risk/reward appetite, and borrowers to apply for and receive unsecured or partially secured loans. It enables financial inclusion globally through **fair and instant unsecured loans** based on a **self-sovereign identity** and **decentralized risk management**.

Financial health metrics are combined with additional off-chain data and on-chain loan reputation to create a new type of decentralized identity that we call the Self-sovereign Financial Identity. It contains verifiable credentials from different sources and is presented in front of lending pools to assert creditworthiness. For its part, the lending part of the protocol operates on 2 levels. Global lending pools are funded by large investors who then delegate the actual lending activity to local guilds having their local lending ponds.

By building Growr, we are addressing significant global challenges such as access to financial services at fair conditions, gender inequality and bad financial health. Bringing true value to all protocol participants, Growr could be a catalyst for the next wave of exponential adoption of DeFi ecosystem and in particular RSK network.
