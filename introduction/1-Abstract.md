# Abstract
Growr is an open, fair and sustainable lending protocol on top of bitcoin. Growr enables financial inclusion globally through **fair and instant unsecured loans** based on a **self-sovereign identity** and **decentralized credit risk management**. Growr supports institutional and individual investors to fund lending pools according to their risk/reward appetite, and borrowers to apply for and receive unsecured or partially secured loans.

Financial health metrics are combined with additional off-chain data and on-chain loan reputation to create a new type of decentralized identity for borrowers that we call the Self-sovereign Financial Identity. It contains verifiable credentials from trusted parties - local organizations that has knowledge about their community. The borrowers are able to use their financial record with collected credentials to easily apply for a loan from a global marketplace and receive the money they need to achieve their goals. 

By building Growr, we are addressing significant global challenges such as high price of financial services, gender inequality, lack of trust and bad financial health. Bringing true value to all protocol participants, Growr could be a catalyst for the next wave of exponential adoption of decentralized finance on RSK network.
