# Use Cases

## Microfinance
The global microfinance market amounted to $124B in 2018 [(link)](https://www.convergences.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Microfinance-Barometer-2019_web-1.pdf). 139.9 million borrowers benefited from the services of microfinance institutions, compared to only 98 million in 2009. Of these 139.9 million borrowers, 80% are women and 65% are rural borrowers. The main regions of microfinance are Latin America with $48.3B, South Asia with $36.8B, East Asia and Pacific with $21.5B, Africa with $10.3B. Connecting this market to a protocol for a global loan marketplace will bring efficiency in capital allocation, fair conditions, and transparency of the impact.

## Lending to vulnerable social groups
Vulnerable populations such as victims of violence, natural and man-made disasters, as well as micro-merchants from poor communities are a prime beneficiary of the protocol. Such populations can rely on memberships within local associations, who can become both credential providers and funding donors. In addition to lending, donations can also benefit from a global and open protocol, giving the donors a complete transparency of the impact of each dollar they give.

## Informal community savings groups
Over the last 25 years, development organizations have trained about 750,000 savings groups, with over 15M members, across 73 countries [(link)](https://mangotree.org/what-are-savings-groups). Digitalizing such savings groups can bring about a global revolution in financial health as more communities get access to and begin to utilize this concept.

## Crowdfunding
The crowdfunding business model continues to grow fast globally. In addition to the established platforms for investment in startups and product R&D, impact finance providers such as Kiva are helping micro-businesses with loans for as little as $25. Crowdfunding transition to the blockchain is a matter of time, as the example of Kick-starter shows [(link)](https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/kickstarter-plans-to-move-its-crowdfunding-platform-to-the-blockchain).
