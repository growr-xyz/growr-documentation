# Challenges

## Regulatory compliance
Lending services are regulated everywhere in the world. Crypto lending, in particular services provided by decentralized protocols, has succeeded in achieving regulatory arbitrage. The Growr protocol will aim to strike a balance between covering regulation at the "last mile‚Äù of consumer financing depending on the jurisdiction and the locally residing stakeholders through which the protocol services are delivered, and the supranational decentralized space outside of the reach of traditional regulators. 

## Credit risk assessment
While we plan to leverage verifiable credentials from traditional credit bureaus, we envision a future with more decentralized credit risk assessment based on alternative data sources. This is mostly uncharted territory and may lead to lower yield for investors or even losses due to incorrect calculation of the cost of risk.

## Governance
While protocol governance is not novel, setting up a global DAO with complex roles and coordinating them poses still unknown challenges. We will continue to explore the best practices in the space and leverage DAO success stories.

## User experience
Setting up Bitcoin and RSK wallets is still complicated for technically unsophisticated users. As part of the work on the Growr protocol, we will seek the most user-friendly implementations for accessing the protocol and interacting with its smart contracts, including facilitating access through custodial solutions.

## Fraud
We expect that such a protocol will be a high-interest target of fraudsters. We will work on developing the right anti-fraud measures including permanent blacklisting of users from accessing the protocol services.

## Technology maturity
Some of the technologies described in this whitepaper are new and unproven at such scale. We aim to leverage as much as possible the experience of other projects and avoid technology pitfalls.
