# Protocol Overview
## Problem
Financial health is an important factor in our daily life. However, bad ﬁnancial health is plaguing the world. More than half of the global population is living paycheck-to-paycheck without any savings [(link)](https://globalﬁndex.worldbank.org/sites/globalﬁndex/ﬁles/chapters/2017%20Findex%20full%20report_chapter5.pdf). In addition, almost 2 billion adults in the world do not have access to ﬁnancial services [(link)](https://ufa.worldbank.org/en/ufa) or if they do, they receive loans at a very high interest rate. Moreover, there are still 72 countries where women from speciﬁc social groups do not have the right to open a bank account or obtain credit [(link)](https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GGGR_2020.pdf).  
At the same time, even people who have savings in cash or in a bank account are also impacted. On the one hand, macroeconomic events, such as high inﬂation, are literally “eating their money” and on the other hand, they are not able to acknowledge the disruptive change that is happening to the ﬁnancial system.
## Solution
We propose the **Growr protocol** as a bridge to a new global financial environment. The Growr protocol advances financial inclusion by enabling borrowers to receive fair & instant unsecured loans based on a self-sovereign identity.  
Growr protocol addresses the problems stated above with the following components: 
- **Growr core protocol** – a decentralized smart contract ecosystem for funding and consuming loans on top of the RSK blockchain, with open access for everyone.
- **Self-sovereign ﬁnancial identity (SSFI)** – a digital identity, based on W3C DID standard, owned and managed by the user.
- **Protocol access via web and mobile applications** - a simple and secure way for consumers and merchants to easily apply and obtain fair loans.
- **Credit risk assessment** – a framework for establishing trust using a combination of alternative approaches such as on-chain activity, trusted off-chain sources, peer vouching, and others.
- **Growr DAO** - a future decentralized autonomous organization for protocol governance and fair compensation of protocol contributors
## Benefits
The Growr protocol distributes the generated value fairly between all ecosystem participants.
