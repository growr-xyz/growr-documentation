## Description

Projects can be funded in 2 ways â€“ (1) directly by the project owner (usually - the lender) or (2) by applying for funds from a lending pool. The latter approach requires the creation of global lending pools that group projects with similar risk levels and financing conditions. The lending pools play the role of investment funds for the projects.
