# Core Protocol
The core protocol is based on smart contracts on the RSK chain that match supply and demand, connecting investors to borrowers with their preferred risk proÔ¨Åle. Each lending pool, each local pond, as well as each individual loan, are powered by smart contracts. We foresee the initial currency of choice to be USD-denominated stablecoin such as RDOC. The RSK smart contract network, protected by the Bitcoin network computing power and hashing mechanism, will ensure the security of the smart contracts and transactions.
