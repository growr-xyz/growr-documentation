1. While creating the loan offer, the _originator_ defines the project funding terms and available payment rails.
2. A _capital provider_ reviews the projects with their predefined eligibility criteria and funding parameters, assesses the risk and confirms his investment intent.
3. The _capital provider_ deploys funding to the project as a senior tranche via any of the possible payment rails.
4. The _originator_ utilizes the provided capital and performs the actual lending activity to the _borrowers_.
5. The _capital provider_ monitors the performance of their investment through Growr protocol that provides reporting of real-time events and full transparency into how the capital is deployed into borrower subscriptions.
6. According to the agreed funding terms, the _originator_ repays back the senior tranche plus the generated yield.
