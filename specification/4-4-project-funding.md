## Project funding

Currently, Growr protocol supports 4 types of funding sources:

- _Traditional (bank account):_ Growr protocol does not monitor or manage any payments; they are executed “off-chain” and registered in the system by the originator.
- _Digital (on-chain wallet):_ Growr protocol monitors project wallet and automatically tracks all investments and repayments.
- _Digital (multisig wallet):_ Growr protocol creates a multisig wallet, in which the investor transfers digital assets. To claim the money from the wallet, the originator signs a loan agreement. After repaying back the assets to the multisig wallet, the investor is able to claim the money back.
- _Crowdfunding:_ Growr protocol supports bitcoin crowdfunding leveraging Lightning Network as a payment rail and Nostr as message exchange. Crowdfunded projects have a Nostr profile and multiple investors can fund them via zap messages in Nostr.
