## Participants

### Borrowers

_Borrowers_, represented by self-employed, micro-businesses, and smallholder farmers, apply for productive loans from the marketplace, most often with the help of a local originator, and then repay the loan plus its price.

### Originators

_Originators_ facilitate access to the protocol by grouping several borrowers with similar needs and presenting project applications to the marketplace on their behalf. They publish offers to the loan marketplace by creating _projects_ on behalf of the borrowers. The originators provide junior (first-loss) capital to finance the whole project or part of it. They can be:

- _Local cooperatives, guilds or other community organizations_ that are formed by borrowers to gain better access to loans and to standardize their relationship with the rest of the participants in the ecosystem.
- _Bitcoin circular economies_ using solutions such as Federated Chaumian mints, enabling access to micro-financing to their users.
- _Telcos, retailers and gig-economy platforms_ that onboard and vet the users into their services and then facilitate their access to the protocol as an embedded financial service.
- _Digital wallets and fintech providers_ that already offer financial services and that can expand to unsecured decentralized lending.

### Trusted parties

_Trusted parties_ assert facts about the borrowers in the form of verifiable credentials. They can be:

- The _originator_, issuing credentials for its members or users.
- _Merchants, buyers, unions, chambers or other local organizations_ that serve the community or have knowledge of their members.
- _Independent third-party data providers_ that can issue credentials related to the activity of the borrower and relevant to the risk assessment process, such as KYC/AML, account data, and on-chain activity.
- _Financial health providers_ that publish educational materials and tools to help borrowers develop good financial habits and issue credentials that assert knowledge, skills, and accomplishments.

### Capital providers

_Capital providers_ allocate senior capital to the loan marketplace and delegate the actual lending activity to the originators in the form of senior tranches for the financed projects. They can be:

- Individual bitcoin investors.
- Large institutional investors or digital asset managers.
- Decentralized finance protocols.
