# Core Protocol
The core protocol is based on smart contracts on the RSK chain that match supply and demand, connecting Liquidity Providers to Borrowers with their preferred risk profile. Each lending pool, each local pond, as well as each individual loan, are powered by smart contracts on RSK chain. The RSK smart contract network, protected by the Bitcoin network computing power and hashing mechanism, will ensure the security of the smart contracts and transactions. We foresee the initial currency of choice to be USD-denominated stablecoin such as RDOC.

The protocol implements the following smart contracts:
- **Pool Factory** smart contract.
- **Pool** smart contract.
- **Pond Factory** smart contract.
- **Pond** smart contract.
- **Loan Registry** smart contract.
- **Trusted Service Registry** smart contract.
