# Protocol Governance

- Applicable lending pool parameters
- Backstop pools of potentially fraudulent Liquidity Providers

## Pond Factory governance
The Governance Board will manage the deployed instance of the Pond Factory smart contract and will decide on:
- Applicable lending pond parameters
- Backstop ponds of potentially fraudulent Lenders

## Trusted Service Registry governance
The Governance Board will manage the deployed instance of the global Trusted Service Registry smart contract and will decide on:
- New trusted Risk Assessors to be added
- New trusted Issuers to be added
- Risk Assessors and Issuers with bad behavior or low performance to be removed

## Safety Fund
In order to provide the Governance Board with incentive to assume responsibility for governance failures, Growr will require the board members to stake their tokens to activate governance power. As an additional safety measure, the protocol will continuously route a portion of the fees generated by the protocol to the safety funds of the protocol.
